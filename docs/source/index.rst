Pixie 
=====
A small, fast, native lisp with "magical" powers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pixie is a lightweight lisp suitable for both general use as well as shell scripting. The standard library is heavily inspired by Clojure as well as several other functional programming languages. 

Pixie implements its own virtual machine. It does not run on the JVM, CLR or Python VM. It implements its own bytecode, has its own GC and JIT. 

**Pixie is still in a "pre-alpha" phase and as such changes fairly quickly.**

**This documentation is also still in development**
